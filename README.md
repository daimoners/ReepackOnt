# ReepackOnt

This is an ontology used to standardize data coming from the _Reepack_ company in the context of the **DESIGN-IT** project. It is not intended to be used in other real-world scenarios.

Its classes are taken from different **IOF** ontologies, namely the _Core_ ontology and the _SupplyChain_ ontology. We added a single concept, `FoldingBox` &mdash; as a subclass of one of the imported classes &mdash; to prove that one can extend previously formalized knowledge to adhere to his/her own needs.
